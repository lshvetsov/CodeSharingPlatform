# DB
~~- code snippets code may be secret with limitations on views and time~~
~~- it needs to track the remains of limitations~~
~~- code snippets should be deleted after reaching at least one limitation~~
~~- id is UUID~~

# Representation
~~- secret code snippets should be skipped from _/latest_~~
- it needs to show the remains of limitations
~~- in case of reaching limitations, we should delete the code snippet~~
- it needs to vary HTML output (get by UUID) based on the limitations present

# Posting
~~- add two parameters as an input (time and views)~~
